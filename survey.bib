	abstract = {Many of today's applications such as cellular network management, prediction and control of the spread of biological and mobile viruses, etc., depend on the modeling and prediction of human locations. However, having widespread wireless localization technology, such as pervasive cell-tower/{GPS} location estimation available for only the last few years, many factors that impact human mobility patterns remain underresearched. Furthermore, many industries including telecom providers are still in need of low-cost and simple location/place prediction methods that can be implemented on a large scale. In this paper, we focus on “temporal factors” and demonstrate that they significantly impact randomness, size, and probability distribution of people's movements. We also use this information to make simple and inexpensive prediction models for subscribers' visited places. We monitored individuals for a month and divided days and hours into segments for each user to obtain probability distribution of their places for each segment of time intervals and observed major improvement in future “time-based” predictions of their location compared to when temporal factors were not considered. In addition to quantifying the improvement in place prediction, we show that significant improvements can actually be achieved through an intuitive division of time intervals with no added computational complexity.},

Here we study the trajectory of 100,000 anonymized mobile phone users whose position is tracked for a six-month period. We find that, in contrast with the random trajectories predicted by the prevailing Lévy flight and random walk models, human trajectories show a high degree of temporal and spatial regularity, each individual being characterized by a time-independent characteristic travel distance and a significant probability to return to a few highly frequented locations. After correcting for differences in travel distances and the inherent anisotropy of each trajectory, the individual travel patterns collapse into a single spatial probability distribution, indicating that, despite the diversity of their travel history, humans follow simple reproducible patterns. This inherent similarity in travel patterns could impact all phenomena driven by human mobility, from epidemic prevention to emergency response, urban planning and agent-based modelling.},

	abstract = {During the past few decades, technologies such as remote sensing, geographical information systems, and global positioning systems have transformed the way the distribution of human population is studied and modeled in space and time. However, the mapping of populations remains constrained by the logistics of censuses and surveys. Consequently, spatially detailed changes across scales of days, weeks, or months, or even year to year, are difficult to assess and limit the application of human population maps in situations in which timely information is required, such as disasters, conflicts, or epidemics. Mobile phones ({MPs}) now have an extremely high penetration rate across the globe, and analyzing the spatiotemporal distribution of {MP} calls geolocated to the tower level may overcome many limitations of census-based approaches, provided that the use of {MP} data is properly assessed and calibrated. Using datasets of more than 1 billion {MP} call records from Portugal and France, we show how spatially and temporarily explicit estimations of population densities can be produced at national scales, and how these estimates compare with outputs produced using alternative human population mapping methods. We also demonstrate how maps of human population changes can be produced over multiple timescales while preserving the anonymity of {MP} users. With similar data being collected every day by {MP} network providers across the world, the prospect of being able to map contemporary and changing human population distributions over relatively short intervals exists, paving the way for new applications and a near real-time understanding of patterns and processes in human geography.},

Here, we uncover the mechanism responsible for the daily mobility patterns by analysing the temporal and spatial trajectories of thousands of persons as individual networks. Using the concept of motifs from network theory, we find only 17 unique networks are present in daily mobility and they follow simple rules. These networks, called here motifs, are sufficient to capture up to 90 per cent of the population in surveys and mobile phone datasets for different countries. Each individual exhibits a characteristic motif, which seems to be stable over several months. Consequently, daily human mobility can be reproduced by an analytically tractable framework for Markov chains by modelling periods of high-frequency trips followed by periods of lower activity as the key ingredient.},

Existing models of movement either pertain to overly coarse scales, simulate some aspects of movement but not others, or were designed specifically for populations in developed countries. Here, we propose a generalizable framework for simulating the locations that an individual visits, time allocation across those locations, and population-level variation therein. As a case study, we fit alternative models for each of five aspects of movement (number, distance from home and types of locations visited; frequency and duration of visits) to interview data from 157 residents of the city of Iquitos, Peru. Comparison of alternative models showed that location type and distance from home were significant determinants of the locations that individuals visited and how much time they spent there. We also found that for most locations, residents of two neighbourhoods displayed indistinguishable preferences for visiting locations at various distances, despite differing distributions of locations around those neighbourhoods. Finally, simulated patterns of time allocation matched the interview data in a number of ways, suggesting that our framework constitutes a sound basis for simulating fine-scale movement and for investigating factors that influence it.},

To verify whether such a theoretical limit can be approached, we implement a series of Markov chain ({MC}) based models to predict the actual locations visited by each user. Results show that {MC} models can produce a prediction accuracy of 87\% for stationary trajectories and 95\% for non-stationary trajectories. Our findings indicate that human mobility is highly dependent on historical behaviors, and that the maximum predictability is not only a fundamental theoretical limit for potential predictive power, but also an approachable target for actual prediction accuracy.},

	abstract = {Through their normal operation, cellular networks are a repository of continuous location information from their subscribed devices. Such information, however, comes at a coarse granularity both in terms of space, as well as time. For otherwise inactive devices, location information can be obtained at the granularity of the associated cellular sector, and at infrequent points in time, that are sensitive to the structure of the network itself, and the level of mobility of the device. In this paper, we are asking the question of whether such sparse information can help to identify the paths followed by mobile connected devices throughout the day. If such a task is possible, then we would not only enable continuous mobility path estimation for smartphones, but also for the millions of future connected "things". The challenge we face is that cellular data has one to two orders of magnitude less spatial and temporal resolution than typical {GPS} traces. Our contribution is to devise path segmentation, de-noising, and inference procedures to estimate the device stationary location, as well as its mobility path between stationary positions. We call our technique Cell*. We complement the lack of spatio-temporal granularity with information on the cellular network topology, and {GIS} (Geographic Information System). We collect more than 3,000 mobility trajectories over 8 months and show that Cell* achieves a median error of 230m for the stationary location estimation, while mobility paths are estimated with a median accuracy of 70m. We show that mobility path accuracy improves with its length and speed, and counter to our intuition, accuracy appears to improve in suburban areas. Cell* is the first technology, we are aware of, that allows location services for the new generation of connected mobile devices, that may feature no {GPS}, due to cost, size, or battery constraints.},

In this setting, humans are the main carriers of mobile devices. As such, this mobility can be exploited by retrieving inherent user habits, interests, and social features for the simulation and evaluation of various scenarios. Several research challenges concerning human mobility in {OppNets} have been explored in the literature recently. In this paper, we present a thorough survey of human mobility issues in three main groups (1) mobility characteristics, (2) mobility models and traces, and (3) mobility prediction techniques. Firstly, spatial, temporal, and connectivity properties of human motion are explored. Secondly, real mobility traces which have been captured using Bluetooth/Wi-Fi technologies or location-based social networks are summarized. Furthermore, simulation-based mobility models are categorized and state-of-the art articles in each category are highlighted. Thirdly, new human mobility prediction techniques which aim to forecast the three aspects of human mobility, i.e.; users׳ next walks, stay duration and contact opportunities are studied comparatively. To conclude, some major open issues are outlined.},

	abstract = {Call detail records ({CDRs}) have recently been used in studying different aspects of human mobility. While {CDRs} provide a means of sampling user locations at large population scales, they may not sample all locations proportionate to the visitation frequency of a user, owing to sparsity in time and space of voice-calls, thereby introducing a bias. Also, as the rate of sampling is inherently dependent on the calling frequencies of an individual, high voice-call activity users are often chosen for conducting a meaningful study. Such a selection process can, inadvertently, lead to a biased view as high frequency callers may not always be representative of an entire population. With the advent of 3G technology and wide adoption of smart-phones, cellular devices have become versatile end-hosts. As the data accessed on these devices does not always require human initiation, it affords us with an unprecedented opportunity to validate the utility of {CDRs} for studying human mobility. In this work, we investigate various metrics for human mobility studied in literature for over a million cellular users in the San Francisco bay-area, for over a month. Our findings reveal that although the voice-call process does well to sample significant locations, such as home and work, it may in some cases incur biases in capturing the overall spatio-temporal characteristics of individual human mobility. Additionally, we motivate an "artificially" imposed sampling process, vis-a-vis the voice-call process with the same average intensity. We observe that in many cases such an imposed sampling process yields better performance results based on the usual metrics like entropies and marginal distributions used often in literature.},

Unlike previous approaches, which employed coarse-grained mobility data with partial temporal-coverage, we use fine-grained and continuous mobility data for the evaluation of mobility models.We explore the regularity and predictability of human mobility, and evaluate location-dependent and location-independent models with several feature-aided schemes. Our experimental results show that a location-dependent predictor is better than a location-independent predictor for predicting temporal behavior of individual user. The duration of stay at a location is strongly correlated to the arrival time at the current location and the return-tendency to the next location, rather than recent k location sequences.We also find that false-positive predictions can be reduced by adaptive use of mobility models.},

Approaches to this prediction task include eigenvalue decomposition [5], non-linear time series analysis of arrival times [10], and variable order Markov models [1]. However, these approaches all assume sufficient sets of training data. For new users, by definition, this data is typically not available, leading to poor predictive performance. Given that mobility is a highly personal behaviour, this represents a significant barrier to entry. Against this background, we present a novel framework to enhance prediction using information about the mobility habits of existing users. At the core of the framework is a hierarchical Bayesian model, a type of probabilistic semantic analysis [7], representing the intuition that the temporal features of the new user's location habits are likely to be similar to those of an existing user in the system. We evaluate this framework on the real life location habits of 38 users in the Nokia Lausanne dataset, showing that accuracy is improved by 16\%, relative to the state of the art, when predicting the next location of new users.},

We use an ensemble method, in which we extract different mobility patterns with multiple models and then combine these models under a probabilistic framework. The key idea lies in the assumption that human mobility can be explained by several mobility patterns that depend on a sub-set of the contextual variables and these can be learned by a simple model. We showed how this idea can be applied to two specific online prediction tasks: what is the next place a user will visit? and how long will he stay in the current place?. Using smartphone data collected from 153 users during 17 months, we show the potential of our method in predicting human mobility in real life.},

	abstract = {Modeling human mobility is crucial in the analysis and simulation of opportunistic networks, where contacts are exploited as opportunities for peer-to-peer message forwarding. The current approach to human mobility modeling has been based on continuously modifying models, trying to embed in them the mobility properties (e.g., visiting patterns to locations or specific distributions of inter-contact times) as they arose from trace analysis. As a consequence, with these models it is difficult, if not impossible, to modify the features of mobility or to control the exact shape of mobility metrics (e.g., modifying the distribution of inter-contact times). For these reasons, in this paper we propose a mobility framework rather than a mobility model, with the explicit goal of providing a flexible and controllable tool for modeling mathematically and generating simulatively different possible features of human mobility.

Our framework, named {SPoT}, is able to incorporate the three dimensions–spatial, social, and temporal–of human mobility. The way {SPoT} does this is by mapping the different social communities of the network into different locations, whose members visit with a configurable temporal pattern. In order to characterize the temporal patterns of user visits to locations and the relative positioning of locations based on their shared users, we analyze the traces of real user movements extracted from three location-based online social networks (Gowalla, Foursquare, and Altergeo). We observe that a Bernoulli process effectively approximates user visits to locations in the majority of cases, and that locations that share many common users visiting them frequently tend to be located close to each other. In addition, we use these traces to test the flexibility of the framework, and we show that {SPoT} is able to accurately reproduce the mobility behavior observed in traces. Finally, relying on the Bernoulli assumption for arrival processes, we provide a thorough mathematical analysis of the controllability of the framework, deriving the conditions under which heavy-tailed and exponentially-tailed aggregate inter-contact times (often observed in real traces) emerge.},

This paper aims to address this gap by proposing a random waypoint ({RWP}) mobility model defined on the entire plane and applying it to analyze two key cellular network parameters: handover rate and sojourn time. We first analyze the stochastic properties of the proposed model and compare it to two other models: the classical {RWP} mobility model and a synthetic truncated Levy walk model which is constructed from real mobility trajectories. The comparison shows that the proposed {RWP} mobility model is more appropriate for the mobility simulation in emerging cellular networks, which have ever-smaller cells. Then we apply the proposed model to cellular networks under both deterministic (hexagonal) and random (Poisson) base station ({BS}) models. We present analytic expressions for both handover rate and sojourn time, which have the expected property that the handover rate is proportional to the square root of {BS} density. Compared to an actual {BS} distribution, we find that the Poisson-Voronoi model is about as accurate in terms of mobility evaluation as hexagonal model, though being more pessimistic in that it predicts a higher handover rate and lower sojourn time.},

Previous human mobility studies have typically been built upon empirical single-source data (e.g., cellphone or transit data), which inevitably introduces a bias against residents not contributing this type of data, e.g., call detail records cannot be obtained from the residents without cellphone activities, and transit data cannot cover the residents who walk or ride private vehicles. To address this issue, we propose and implement a novel architecture {mPat} to explore human mobility using multi-source data. A reference implementation of {mPat} was developed at an unprecedented scale upon the urban infrastructures of Shenzhen, China. The novelty and uniqueness of {mPat} lie in its three layers: (i) a data feed layer consisting of real-time data feeds from 24 thousand vehicles, 16 million smart cards and 10 million cellphones; (ii) a mobility abstraction layer exploring the correlation and divergence among the multi-source data to analyze and infer human mobility; and (iii) an application layer to improve urban efficiency based on the human mobility findings of the study. The evaluation shows that {mPat} achieves a 75\% inference accuracy, and that its real-world application reduces passenger travel time by 36\%.},

Using cell phone location data, as well as data from two online location-based social networks, we aim to understand what basic laws govern human motion and dynamics. We find that humans experience a combination of periodic movement that is geographically limited and seemingly random jumps correlated with their social networks. Short-ranged travel is periodic both spatially and temporally and not effected by the social network structure, while long-distance travel is more influenced by social network ties. We show that social relationships can explain about 10\% to 30\% of all human movement, while periodic behavior explains 50\% to 70\%. Based on our findings, we develop a model of human mobility that combines periodic short range movements with travel due to the social network structure. We show that our model reliably predicts the locations and dynamics of future human movement and gives an order of magnitude better performance than present models of human mobility.},

We investigate the application of kernel density estimation ({KDE}) to this problem using a mixture model approach that can interpolate between an individual's data and broader patterns in the population as a whole. The mixture-{KDE} approach is evaluated on two large geolocation/check-in data sets, from Twitter and Gowalla, with comparisons to non-{KDE} baselines, using both log-likelihood and detection of simulated identity theft as evaluation metrics. Our experimental results indicate that the mixture-{KDE} method provides a useful and accurate methodology for capturing and predicting individual-level spatial patterns in the presence of noisy and sparse data.},

	doi = {10.1109/PerCom.2014.6813948},
	abstract = {It has been recently claimed that human movement is highly predictable. While an upper bound of 93\% predictability was shown, this was based upon human movement trajectories of very high spatiotemporal granularity. Recent studies reduced this spatiotemporal granularity down to the level of {GPS} data, and under a similar methodology results once again suggested a high predictability upper bound (i.e. 90\% when movement was quantized down to a spatial resolution approximately the size of a large building). In this work we reconsider the derivation of the upper bound to movement predictability. By considering real-world topological constraints we are able to achieve a tighter upper bound, representing a more refined limit to the predictability of human movement. Our results show that this upper bound is between 11-24\% less than previously claimed at a spatial resolution of approx. 100m×100m, with a greater improvement for finer spatial resolutions. This indicates that human mobility is potentially less predictable than previously thought. We provide an in-depth examination of how varying the spatial and temporal quantization affects predictability, and consider the impact of corresponding limits using a large set of real-world {GPS} traces. Particularly at fine-grained spatial quantizations, where a significant number of practical applications lie, these new (lower) upper limits raise serious questions about the use of location information alone for prediction, contributing more evidence that such prediction must integrate external variables.},
