Introduction
  Opportunistic networks need understanding of spatial and temporal dynamics of contacts [Human mobility]


Spatiotemporal Granularity
  Spatially coarse, Temporally coarse
    The most widely used datasets for evaluating human mobility have exhibited high temporal irregularities and spatial coarseness: call detail records (CDRs) for cellular telephones and WiFi Access Point registration logs. Common between these two data sets is the association of a user's location to that of the base station's location. However, the true location of a wireless user may be at any place where a wireless communication channel can be established between the user's device and the base station, which is often represented as a circular/hexagonal wireless connectivity range, or as a Voronoi diagram that partitions the extent of the available 2D space [Understanding individual][Limits]. This contributes to the spatial coarseness of the datasets. The temporal sparsity primarily due to human-initiated activities on their wireless device.
    
    CDRs represent either a voice call or an SMS occurring between two phones preserved by telecommunication companies for purposes of billing. These records have associated with them the unique identifier of the receiver and the initiater of a call, the starting and ending time of the call, and the unique identifier of the cellular tower being used as a basestation. Cross referencing the tower's identifier with the company's geographic information systems (GIS) provides the geographic coordinates of the tower. The set of surveyed papers performaning analysis on CDRs is [Limits][schneider_unravelling_2013][zhang_exploring_2014][Understanding individual][zhang_user_2014][Approaching][The Impact][Human Mobility][Evaluating Mobility Models][Friendship and Mobility][From Cells][Are][Time-Clustering]. Although these datasets are widely recorded and archived by telecommunication companies, privacy concerns and trade secrets primarily prevent such data being publicly accessible for scrutiny. The only publicly available CDR dataset of which this author is currently aware is [MIT Reality Mining]. It is observed that many of the aforementioned papers have co-authors with email domains associated with large telecommunication companies, thus hinting that strategic partnerships may enable one access to such information.

    WiFi registration logs represent the action of a WiFi-enabled device attempting to connect to a WiFi Access Point (AP). Upon successful registration, the device's unique MAC address is recorded, along with the MAC address of the connected AP and the time of registration. Cross referencing the AP's MAC address with an appropriate GIS produces a geographic location of the stationary AP. WiFi registration logs do not record any activity occuring over the wireless channel, such as the downloading of content through the Internet or the deregistration of a device, and thus only represent the creation of a wireless channel.
  
    
    WiFi contact paths
          WiFi access point registration also exhibits spatially and temporally coarse resolutions for stationary users. Users in motion may have more frequent temporal snapshots, but the spatial resolution still remains coarse subject to the coverage area of an AP. 
          
      [Evaluating Next]
        Dartmouth WLAN mobility trace
        Two years the sequence of wireless cells frequented by more than 6k users.
        Data records registration of devices to APs, and not the physical movement of human users.
        Location of users may be estimated based on the location of the AP they access.

    Call Detail Records
     [Friendship and Mobility]
      European cell phone service provider.
      Two million users, 450 million phone calls, 455 days.
      Each call records nearest cell tower to both sender and recipient of call.
      Spatially accuracy of approximately 3km.
      Only consider calls between recipients at least five times, between people in the same country.
     [Evaluating Mobility Models]
      For a city such as Seoul, average number of places in most associated cell-tower regions is 11+/- 2.
      A person could visit 11 different places, but the sequence of visits would be lost due to the spatial coarseness of cell tower coverage.
      Likewise, a person under a cell tower could be at any one of the 11 locations ,or they could simply be passing through the location without visiting any of the locations.
      Mobility data captured by cell towers could indicate that a person visited 11 different places.
      
    [Human Mobility]
      CDRs from Los Angelos and New York for the span of 3 months. Hundreds of thousands of phones, billions of location samples.

    [zhang_user_2014] is the only paper to acknowledge that inaccuracies in cellular phone tower datasets, in which coverage areas often overlap, and a phone may exhibit round-robin handoffs with all neighboring towers without moving at all.
    [schneider_unravelling_2013]
    [zhang_exploring_2014]
    [Understanding individual]
      Two datasets, one being CDRs, and another being regular interval (every two hours) of cell tower location.
      Average service area of each tower is approximately 3km^2, with over 30% towers covering area of 1 km^2 or less, due to higher density of towers for areas with increase cell phone usage (i.e. urban areas)

    [Limits]
      From CDRs, approximately 70% of hour-long intervals during the observation period have no location updates due to no phone calls being made. These periods of silent periods exist in smaller proportions when using data session records [zhang_user_2014].

    Improvement to CDRs:
      [From Cells]
        Coarseness of CDRs may be complemented by understanding the cellular network topology in use, as well as observing the road network existing in a coverage area.
        Cell* was able to identify stationary positions with a median error of 230 meters, comparable to GSM triagulation technologies which use active probing of subscriber's signal strength.
        Mobile devices in motion had an even more improved median error of 70 meters through path inference, with a further improvement of a mobile trajectory being observed as the velocity of the device increases.
      [Are][zhang_user_2014] analyzes a superset of CDRs which, along with including records for voice calls and SMS, also includes data sessions initiated by the mobile phone, either as a part of user-initiated activity (e.g. querying a search engine) or device-initiated activities (e.g. push-updated email client).
      [Time-Clustering]
        Call Detail Records for voice calls, SMS, and data sessions through the Sprint CDMA network of San Francisco area.
        Location was further estimated by analyzing travel time of the signal from the mobile device to the base station and through the use of trilaterialation. (footnote: it should be noted that having a co-author working for a major telecommunications provider provides one with a rich collection of data otherwise unaccessible to the researching community)
        Median of accuracy is 200 meters with a variable of 200 meters.

      Place is recognized with room-level accuracy in indoor and outdoor environements using GSM, WiFi, and GPS.
      Movement patterns recorded every two minutes.
      10 users over a period of two months.
    [Contextual]
      153 particular over 17 months, recording GPS, WiFI APs, calling logs, application interaction logs
    [Where and What]
      WiFi signatures can be used to calculate a user's location based on nearby WiFi access points
      Provides better resolution than cell tower based methods
      Requires WiFi hotspots, though it was found that in an urban environment, users spend 2.1 +/- 1.7% of their time in non-WiFi regions [Evaluating]. This may present a problem in rural environments where WiFi adoption or population density may be sparse.

  GPS Trajectories
    [A Refined]
    Not available for some indoor locations.
    Altitude is required to determine which floor of a building one is located.
    GeoLife dataset provides altitude in approximately 45% of their GPS records [GeoLife?]
    Problem of ambiguous location associativity when considering a multi-leveled building.
      exact GPS record may correspond to many unique locations on different floors of the same building.
      potentially problematic for malls, sky-scrapers in urban environments
     



  Spatially fine, Temporally coarse
   Location-based Social Networks
    Richer semantic history.
      Locations in Foursquare are often annotated with unique tags describing a classification of the location.
        e.g. Indian restaurant, historical landmark, supermarket
      Solves the problem of ambiguous location associativity.
    Explicit social networks (who are a user's friends?)
    Provides analyzing correlations between user's movements and friend's movements.
    [Friendship and Mobility]
      From check-in data provided by Gowalla and Brightkite, 84% of people checking in at a particular place have less than 20% of their check-ins preceeded by a friend's check-in at the same place [Friendship and Mobility].
      Gowalla and Brightkite contain explicit social networks.
        Gowalla has undirected friend graphs (both parties must agree to friendship)
        Brightkite has directed friend graphs (possible asymmetric friendships)
    Location-fine to coarse, Temporal fine.
    Some LBSNs do not allow public access to user-specific location traces due to security concerns, such as Foursquare [SPoT].
      e.g. Foursquare aggregates check-in information for a particular business, specifying how many
            unique users visited, how many people checked in, etc.
           Twitter provides an avenue for people to publicly share their Foursquare check-ins, and thus
            Twitter coupled with Foursquare allows for associating users to locations at certain times.
    [SPoT]
      Gowalla provided a public API where analysis of user-specific checkins could be analyzed by researchers. Unfortunately, Facebook acquired Gowalla in December 2011, and had shut down the service in 2012.

Constraint-based Mobility
  Geographic constraints
   [Contextual, Where and What]
      Results: location and time contexts were the best predictors for conditional transitions in movement
   [A Refined]
      Considering topological constraints can provide a tightened upper bound on the predictability of movement.
      Some locations are simply unreachablefor next-step movement.
      Their approach also limits the rate of over-estimation of an upper bound as the spatial (temporal) quantization becomes more fine (coarse)-grained
  Destinations
    [Friendship and Mobility]
      Discretizing the workd into 25x25km cells, and defining "home" for a particular user as the average position in the cell with the most checkins.
      85% accuracy.
  Velocity
  Temporal Factors
    [Contextual, Where and What]
      Results: location and time contexts were the best predictors for conditional transitions in movement
    [Time-Clustering]
      "Time division" is used for location prediction.
      Intelligently dividing time based on the semantic activity, as opposed to naively dividing the week into days, and the days into hours, resulted in 90.7% accurancy in short-term prediction. Naive time slicing results in 87.7% short-term prediciton accuracy.
      Additional information on randomness and distributions of movement based on time slices: location entropy, radius of gyration, step size, spatial probability distribution of users
    [The Impact]
  Social constraints
    [NextCell] 
    [Friendship] found that social relationships explain 10~30% of all movements, with long-distance movements having a strong correlation towards a social friend residing in that location.

     

The Predictability of Human Mobility
  Metrics of Interest:
    Population density in spatial region
      [Dynamic population]
        Cell phone records could be used to determine population density, human activity at very fine-scales in urban environments.
        Show figure of Portugal.
      [Human Mobility]
        
    Transition rates between spatial regions
    Sojourn time within current location
      [Contextual]
      [Theory]
        The key interest in [Theory] was to predict the accumulated amount of time spent performaning a certain activity, such as visiting relatives, attending the theater, or having one's automobile undergo maintenance.
        These activity classes can be associated with a set of physical locations (multiple relatives living in different parts of the country), and can be annotated as "routine activities" or "on-demand activities".
        Locations are added to each class at a constant rate \lambda_i and removed with a constant rate \mu_i.
        If locations are removed in the order by which they were added, then each class within an individual's activity space can be modeled as a M/M/1 queue.

    Inter-arrival times
      [SPoT]
        Analysis on LBSN data: how to characterize the way users visit locations and how to position meeting places in a considered scenario.
        Studies time sequences of individual user arrivals at places
        Majority of user-place pairs (66-54% of pairs, varying over the LBSN datasets) may be approximated by a Bernoulli process.
          Intervales between consecutive arrivals follow a geometric distribution.
        Contact sequences between the majority of user pairs (78-87%) may also be approximated by a Bernoulli process.
        Study correlation between distances between locations and number of regular visistors: locations that share many common users that visit them frequently tend to be located close to each other.
 
    Location entropy
      [Time-Clustering]
      [Limits]
        Three methods of entropy were used for analysis.
          Random entropy, temporal-uncorrelated entropy, and actual entropy (depends on freq of visitation and order and time spent at each location)
      [The Impact]
      [Are][zhang_user_2014] from the point of view of higher-frequency data records associated with 2G/3G/4G connectivity.
    Radius of gyration
      "The characteristic distance travelled by a user a when observed up to time t" [Understanding]
      [Time-Clustering]
      [Understanding]
        P(r_g) = (r_g + r_g^0)^{-\beta_r} e^{-r_g / \kappa}
          r_g^0 = 5.8 km
          \beta_r = 1.65 +/- 0.15
          \kappa = 350km
        How does radius of gyration depend on time of observance? Results inciate the time dependence of the average radius of gyration of mobile phone users best approximated by a logarithmic increase. Asymptotic to the time of observation, radius of gyration appears similar to a saturation process.

        Daily travel ranges are synthesized, observing an median of error less than 0.8 and 1.0 miles for NY and LA residents.

      [The Impact]
      [Are]
      [schneider_unravelling_2013] found that the radius of gyration is often very chaotic during an initial observation window, and does not stabilize until a few months of observations has been accumulated. 
    Step size: how much distance was recorded between consecutive records
      [Time-Clustering]

          P(\delta r) = (\delta r + \delta r_0)^{-\beta} e^{-\delta r / \kappa}

            \delta r_0 = 1.5 km

            \kappa|D_2 = 80km

      [The Impact]
    Mean time to return
      [Understanding]
        Peaks occur at 24h, 48 h, 72h, indicating a strong tendencies for people to return regularly to locations visited before.
    Number of different visited locations
      [schneider_unravelling_2013] observed the shape of an observed distribution for the number of unique locations visited in one day follows a log-normal distribution.
        90% of the population visits less than seven locations on a daily basis, found to be common across multiple cities and multiple datasets.

   Cold start problem
    [Improving]
      Transform the transition matrix of a Markov model representing an established users' mobility to the mobility of the new user
      16% increased accuracy relative to "state of the art predictor", in which lower order Markov model was trained on small amount of data from new user.
      Transformation framework reaches its upper limit rapidly, but soon begins to degrade after time while the trained Markov model continues to steadily perform better.
      
  Short-term mobility prediction
    [Where and What]
      "We focus on anticipating human behavior for the very short future (the next ten minutes) and on active time slots of location changes or app usage".
        i.e. where will the user be in 10 minutes if he/she is about to move
    [Contextual] addresses the question "when will the user leave the current place"
      Online prediction: predict the value at time t+1 when the past values up to time t are given.
      Results: location and time contexts were the best predictors for conditional transitions in movement
    [Time-Clustering][The Impact]
      Time of day/day of week has an impact on entropy, size of mobility and spatial distribution. Entropy is the smallest impacted. Radius of gyration, step size, spatial distriubtion change significantly based on the day and time.

  [Friendship and Mobility]
    10% of human mobility from cellular mobility data is explained by social ties.
    30% of of movement from LBSN is explained by social ties.
    Periodic movement explains 50% to 70%.
    40% accuracy of location prediction at any time. Average relative distance error of 0.23% for cell phone locations and 2.7% for social check-ins.
    NUMBER OF CHECK-INS AS A FUNCTION OF DISTANCE FROM HOME.
      Distribution follows power law with exponential cutoff [FIGURE].
  [Evaluating Mobility Models]
    How much regularity and predictability is inherent in human movements?
    Which features are strongly correlated to temporal bx?
    Which mobility model is best for the prediction of temporal bx?
    Key challenges:
      Quantify predictable regularity in human bx
      Define meaningful features for extraction of useful info
      Predict next location within duration of stay
  [Interdependence]
    Use of multivariate nonlinear predictor can achieve high accuracy in forcasting future user geographic locations
    The concept of mutual information is used to quantify correlation between two mobility traces. It is possible to exploit movement data of friends and acquaintences when available - such as through location-based social networks.
    How the correlation measure through mutual information of mobility traces of two individuals can be used to improve human prediction movement.
    Key findings:
      Multivariate nonlinear time series techniques can improve prediction movement of users by considering movement of people with correlated mobility patterns.
      Additionally, mutual information can be used to select pairs of users as inferred-friends if there is no social ties available.
  [Contextual, Where and What]
    Estimates the conditional probabilities over the set of destinations that a user may travel given current context (i.e. location, time)
      Location, time, app usage, Bluetooth proximity, comm. logs
    What is the impact of each data type to the predicctive performance of next location and app usage?
  [Limits]
    Goal is to quantify the interplay between regular, predictable mobility and random, unforeseeable.
    What fundamental limits characterize the predictability of human dynamics?
    Lacks a constructive algorithm to approach this upper bound.
    Plus, knowing an upper bound is not very useful if this upper bound is not relatively tight. One can easily claim "I am at most 100% certain that 2+2=5" without being wrong.
  [A Refined] realizes this issue and focuses on tightening the bounds of location predictability.
  [zhang_user_2014] also investigates the characteristics of movement data extracted from data records, as compared to purely CDRs and LBSN checkins.


====================================

Synthetic Models
  Many past papers have assumed naive, random mobility models to simulate human movement in an environment.
  Random Walks, Levy Flights [Towards]. These simply do not agree with real-world data, as much research analyzing real-world mobility data shows distinct regularlity and predictability in the movement of people. [Human Mobility]
  This survey paper does not consider works that simulate without validation.
  Individual mobility models
    [Friendship and Mobility]
      People show strong periodic bx during certain durations of time throughout the day.
      Weekdays have mobility bx alternating between home and work.
      Weekends have mobility bx alternating between home and social network driven locations.
      Three components to model:
        1. Spatial locations regularly visited by user, spatially correlated with a user's work and home location.
        2. Model of temporal movement between locations
        3. Model of movement influenced by social network (e.g. meeting friends)
      Day-specific periodic model
    [schneider_unravelling_2013] looks at statistically reproducing the mobility patterns of intracity, daily movements.
    [Evaluating Next] found through training of an O(2) Markov predictor with a fallback for previously unseen conditional context found median prediction accuracy of 63%, with 72% accuracy being reached with users having 1,000k or more cell crossings. However, the authors comment that there was significant variance between the predictor's accuracy between users.
  Population density models
    [Human Mobility]
      Given an input for the spatiotemporal distribution of CDR records, create a model for producing synthetic CDRs that matches the distribution produced.

      Users arriving at locations is represented as a Bernoulli process.
      Proof is provided that when arrival processes are Bernoulli process, the contact process between users is also Bernoulli processes.
      Derived conditions under which heavy-tailed and exponentially tailed aggregate inter-contact times emerge, starting from heterogeneous Bernoulli arrival processes for user visists to locations.
        Confirms heterogeneity in pairwise statistics can lead to aggregate statistics that are very distant in distribtion (?)
  Methods for evaluation

=======================================


Bias towards mobility
  Some papers base their analysis on a small subset of the overall population.
  Students on a college campus (citation needed) may have biased mobility patterns due to attendence of class, and insufficient funds to finance extravagent weekend extersions [NextCell]
  San Francisco dataset may be heavily biased towards professionals of technical companies due to the abundance of such companies in the Bay region (citation needed)[Are]
  Cell phone datasets contain biases towards people who actually carry cell phones and actively use them throughout the day.
  Analysis based on Call Detail Records are coarse, both temporally and spatially, due to sparse and bursty behavior of voice calls.
  [Limits] is biased towards people who make, on average, a cellular phone call every two hours during an observation period of three months.
  [Are] quantifies the bias through the concept of sampling processes.
    Comparison of CDRs versus Poisson point sampling process shows an artificially imposed sampling processes results in better results of a user's spatio-temporal bx in a cellular network.
    CDF of of the number of records and number of hours of activity for each of the three activity types:
      Voice calls contribute least to the CDF
      Data sessions contribute the most.
  [Evaluating Next] based their analysis on WiFi AP registrations for a college campus during June 2001 to Spring 2003 - long before the proliferation of WiFi enabled smartphones - thus biasing towards students with wirelessly-equipped laptop computers. This strongly biases towards students.
